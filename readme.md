#### Installation :
This plugin hasn't been submitted on QGIS plugin repository yet.
It can be installed like this :
```
git clone https://github.com/mthh/SpatialPositionModel.git
cd SpatialPositionModel
make deploy
```

The plugin is now installed and will be available to load in the plugin window of QGIS (think also to allow experimental plugins) under the name **SpatialPositionModel**.
